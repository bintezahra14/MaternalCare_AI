        "\n",
        "MaternalCare_AI is a domain-specific artificial intelligence (AI) assistant developed to bridge critical information gaps in maternal healthcare, particularly for individuals in underserved and high-risk communities. The assistant delivers accurate, accessible, and context-aware responses to maternal health queries by integrating structured geographic vulnerability data with a curated knowledge base of medical guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of the system is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture, which semantically matches user queries to embedded knowledge chunks derived from expert-verified documents. This retrieval is further enhanced by incorporating ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) data, enabling the assistant to tailor responses based on localized health risk indicators such as the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of MaternalCare_AI is to empower users with plain-language, trustworthy insights on topics such as prenatal care, postpartum symptoms, and available community resources. Its lightweight, modular design makes it deployable in low-resource environments, positioning it as a practical tool for improving maternal health literacy and support equity."

        "The maternal healthcare domain was chosen due to the persistent disparities in maternal health outcomes across geographically and socioeconomically vulnerable populations. Women in high-risk ZIP codes often face limited access to timely and reliable health information. This project addresses the urgent need for culturally appropriate, accessible, and geographically personalized maternal health support through an AI-powered assistant.\n",

        "## 2.2 Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the availability of online health resources, many pregnant individuals especially those in marginalized communities—lack access to trustworthy, understandable, and relevant maternal health guidance. Existing materials are frequently fragmented, overly clinical, or disconnected from the lived experiences of their intended users. There is a critical gap in tools that combine localized risk awareness with plain-language health communication.\n",

        "MaternalCare_AI provides a scalable, interpretable, and equity-focused solution to maternal health information access. By combining location-based vulnerability data with retrieval-augmented AI, it delivers relevant, plain-language guidance to users who may otherwise face barriers to care. The system is fully deployable in low-resource settings (e.g., via Google Colab), making it accessible for use in community outreach, mobile health clinics, and digital health platforms."

        "\n",
        "The development of MaternalCare_AI challenged us to apply data science and AI principles to a real-world domain with high social impact - maternal health. Our goal was to create an assistant that could offer plain-language, localized health guidance to underserved communities, particularly those in ZIP codes with high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) scores. Throughout the project, we built a full pipeline that included curated knowledge base creation, semantic chunking, embedding generation, and retrieval-augmented QA through ChromaDB. The assistant was deployed via a Gradio interface to ensure usability for both non-technical users and health outreach workers. One of the key learning outcomes was how to balance simplicity with utility. We made conscious decisions to use free, open-source tools (e.g., Colab, MiniLM, CSV-based KB) to simulate real-world constraints. Our evaluation strategy went beyond just accuracy - we analyzed semantic correctness using a golden QA set and cosine similarity, giving us insights into how useful the answers truly were. Looking forward, we see clear potential for integrating user feedback, adding multilingual support, and expanding the assistant to other public health domains like immunization or pediatric care. The project not only helped us consolidate technical skills but deepened our understanding of equitable AI design.\n",

        "Zahra: Led data preprocessing, developed Gradio UI, and designed the semantic evaluation framework.\n",
        "Virginia: Implemented embedding + retrieval pipeline, managed the SVI and maternal risk datasets, and oversaw model testing and validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "All team members participated in planning, documentation, and final editing. Collaboration was managed using Google Drive, Colab notebooks, and shared version checkpoints. Each member reviewed and approved all final deliverables."
